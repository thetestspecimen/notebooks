# Stanford Dogs Dataset - Three Breeds

This dataset is a selection of the original [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), and contains only the images of the following three breeds:

* Border Collie
* Golden Retriever
* Labrador Retriever

Each category has exactly 150 examples, and the pictures are of varying dimensions, and separated into named folders.

The two retriever breeds have been selected due to their similarity in appearance to ensure that the dataset is a challenge for any classification problem applied to it.
