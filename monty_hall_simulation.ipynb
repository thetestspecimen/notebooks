    "This notebook is designed to simulate the Monty Hall Problem.\n",

    "It is split into two section:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A step-by-step inplementation of the simulation to make it clear exactly what is being calculated\n",
    "2) A one-cell script that can be used to efficiently run the simulation that was created in step 1\n",

    "## What is the Monty Hall Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, there are three \"Doors\", behind one door is a \"prize\", the other two doors have nothing behind them. (You want the prize, obviously) \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, you must select one of the three doors. Once the initial selection is made, one of the remaining doors will be opened to reveal the contents. The door that will be revealed will always have nothing behind it (i.e. it will never be the door with the prize). \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the best strategy to pick the door with the prize? Should you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. stick with the door you initially picked\n",
    "    b. switch to the one remaining closed door"
